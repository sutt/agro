## What is Agro?

Agro is a CLI wrapper that enables you to:

- **Run multiple AI coding agents in parallel** across isolated git worktrees
- **Compare different agent outputs** side-by-side for the same task
- **Manage complex development workflows** with git branches and worktrees
- **Orchestrate agent-based development** with markdown task specifications

### Key Features

- 🏗️ **Worktree Management**: Automatic creation and cleanup of git worktrees
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Support**: Works with aider, claude-code, gemini, and more
- 📋 **Task-Based**: Markdown files define development tasks
- 🔄 **Environment Isolation**: Each worktree gets its own environment configuration
- 🌐 **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple agents simultaneously
- 📊 **Easy Comparison**: Compare results across different agents and models

### Supported Agents

| Agent | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **aider** | AI pair programming assistant | ✅ Fully supported |
| **claude-code** | Anthropic's Claude CLI | ✅ Fully supported |
| **gemini** | Google's Gemini CLI | ✅ Fully supported |

### Quick Example

```bash
# Initialize agro in your project
agro init

# Create a task specification
agro task add-feature
# This will add a file .agdocs/specs/add-feature.md
# It should be opened in automatically in your editor ...
# Edit the task file with your requirements

# Run 3 agents in parallel
agro exec add-feature 3

# Compare results across worktrees
agro muster 'npm test' output/add-feature
```

### Tutorial & Demo

See a simple tutorial here with prebuilt tasks for a python FastAPI server project: https://github.com/sutt/agro-demo

## Philosophy

Agro embraces the principle of **"no magic"** - it's built on standard git operations and shell commands. This means:

- ✅ **Transparency**: All operations are visible and understandable
- ✅ **Interoperability**: Works with existing git workflows and tools
- ✅ **Reliability**: Based on proven, stable technologies
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Can be customized and extended as needed

> **Note**: Agro is not an AI agent itself. It's a micro-framework that orchestrates other AI agents and simplifies the workflow for dispatching, reviewing, and comparing their outputs.
