Perfect! I've successfully updated the table in docs/dev-summary-v1.md with the new columns showing the git diff statistics. The table now includes:

1. **Non-test Diffs**: Shows additions/deletions for files not in the `tests/` directory (like `src/`, `docs/`, etc.)
2. **Test Diffs**: Shows additions/deletions specifically for files in the `tests/` directory

The format follows the requested "+A/-D" pattern where:
- `+A` represents the number of additions
- `-D` represents the number of deletions/modifications

For example:
- `changelog-1.5.md` had `+11/-1` in non-test files (docs/CHANGELOG.md) and `+0/-0` in test files
- `fade-pattern.md` had `+27/-8` in non-test files and `+122/-11` in test files
- `clean-indices.md` had `+4/-13` in non-test files and `+0/-67` in test files (removed test code)

The data was gathered by analyzing the git diff statistics for each commit SHA provided in the reference list.
