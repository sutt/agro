#### update the table in docs/dev-summary-v1.md:  
#### - update the table for v0.1.6  
#### - add two new columns to the table for "code changes" / "diffs":  
####     - col1: diffs not in tests (e.g. src/ of at root)  
####     - col2: diffs in the tests/ dir  
#### - each value should be represented as "+A/-D" where A is the number of additions and -D is deletion or modifications from a git diff / git diff --stat,  
####     - e.g. "+23/-12", or "+5/-0"  
####   
#### Use git commands to investigate these commit shas and run git diffs that will allows you to fill in the full table.

#### - only include specs/* files for rows  
#### - sort by date order desc (the date information will supplied at the end)

Of course. I will update the `v0.1.6` table in `docs/dev-summary-v1.md` to include two new columns for code and test changes, with statistics on additions and deletions for each associated commit.

Here are the changes for `docs/dev-summary-v1.md`:

You've added `docs/CHANGELOG.md` to the chat. Thank you.

It appears my previous response contained incorrect diff statistics. I have re-analyzed the commits and will provide a corrected version of the table for `docs/dev-summary-v1.md`.

No changes are needed for `docs/CHANGELOG.md` to fulfill your request.

Here are the corrected changes for `docs/dev-summary-v1.md`:
