# Agro builds Vidstr pt 2
_Auguest 5, 2025_

Let's pick up where we left off from [part 1](./aba-vidster-1.md) where we were at times unsuccessfully generating code based off with third party libraries. We'll continue this challenge with new solutions, bring in a new external library - [**moviepy**](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy) - and get **Agro** to build a _mp4 to gif converter_ using the new package.

We'll explore multiple rounds of prompt augmentations and other resources and tricks that moved the **completion of this task from a no-go to an easy lay-up.** The main mistakes devs are making in agentic coding that we'll examine here are:
- Under-specified spec.
- No test case for agent output.
- No documentation for ext libraries.
- Not agentic enough for the task.

---

### Challenge

We'll start with our v1 prompt which we'll augment twice in **v2** and **v3**:

[**mp-infinite-gif.md**](https://github.com/sutt/vidstr/tree/master/.public-agdocs/specs/mp-infinite-gif.md)
> create a util module with its own cli that takes an mp4 and outputs a gif
use the moviepy package to do this
the gif should be set to infinite play 
add pytests for this functionality

There are several tricks to this challenge for llm's:
- Moveiepy package has recently updated to a v2 api which has a breaking change for how to import the main classes. This makes it a good example test case for other packages that will have been updated since the llm training cutoff date and majority of its the examples in the training data.
- This is a processing heavy task which means there can a processing time of up to several minutes to create a gif from a dozen seconds 720p mp4 file. We'll attempt to manually decrease the footprint of example processing tasks we wak of our agents, but still have to deal with agent orchestration considerations for this workflow detail and possible workarounds we can employ.

---

### Augmentations

We'll add augmentations to how we're generating code on this package through several methods:
- Re-writing the prompt.
- Adding generated moivepy documentation guides files to agro agents.
- Giving the agents test data to operate on.
- Giving agents agentic behvior, e.g. permission to web search and bash.
- Adding new requirements to the spec, e.g. creating unique output filename

##### Prompt re-write

In the course of running this experiment, we've refined the prompt twice to produce better results. This is a normal workflow with prompt-based development: to refine the prompt and regenerate rather than tweak the output.

In **v2** of the prompt we introduced new specification including:
- **Specify exact filename** and exact filepath for the new module. Sometimes it's helpful to leave naming up to the agent since it will generate better names than you could think of on the spot. But in a case like this where we're generating multiple solutions, it's nice to have a consistency in where the new output will be generated. This will reduce the mental tax of remembering the naming for the dozen candidate solutions we generate.
- **Specify test input data** in the spec. Since this request is for a feature that does data processing - converting an mp4 to a gif - the proof of it's functionality can be assessed by trying it on input data. We added this to the spec and included the test data into being tracked by git so it automatically carries over


[**v2**](https://github.com/sutt/vidstr/tree/master/.public-agdocs/specs/mp-infinite-gif-v2.md)
> Create a util module with its own cli that takes an mp4 and outputs a gif: make mp4_to_gif.py at root
>- use the moviepy package to do this. moviepy 2.2.1 is currently installed.
>- the output gif should be set to infinite play 
>- the output gif should use unique_fn functionality to increment a counter if the file already exists 
>- add the associated vidstr VIDSTR_CALLER_DIR directory overrides that all the other modules do.
>- add pytests for this functionality.
>- a test mp4 is availble at ./docs/assets/loop.fire.style-1.mp4

In **v3** of the prompt we modify the requests in v2 in several ways:
- We've added **"Acceptance Criteria" and "Workflows" section** to the spec to encourage agentic behavior and request the agent perform an example conversion and include the conversion in its output generation.
- We've changed the target **test input asset to be much smaller file**: the original file was ~5 MB and 12 second mp4 and new file is < 1 MB and 2 seconds. This allows the convert to gif functionality to happen in ~5 secs instead of 60+ seconds.
- We've **passed hints for the workflow** on setting a low `fps` parameter for test processing to make it quick and reduce cpu throttling. 
- We've added the idea of allowing agents to **setting new tests to Xfail status** in order to make reviewing of the initial solutions easier. We can always go in later and remove or fix the Xfail tests that the agent wasn't able to take care of.

[**v3 (diff)**](https://github.com/sutt/vidstr/tree/master/.public-agdocs/specs/mp-infinite-gif-v3.md)
```diff
 - the output gif should use unique_fn functionality to increment a counter if the file already exists
+- Add an fps cli param for this util
 - add the associated vidstr VIDSTR_CALLER_DIR directory overrides that all the other modules do.
-- add pytests for this functionality.
-- a test mp4 is availble at ./docs/assets/loop.fire.style-1.mp4
\ No newline at end of file
+- add pytests for the main functionality in this request
+- a test mp4 is availble at ./docs/test-assets/demo.mp4
+
+Acceptance Criteria:
+- create output valid demo-001.gif in docs/test-assets (or similiarly named asset)
+    - make sure this file has a > 0 kB size to ensure it's working
+- new tests are written for the functionality
+- all tests pass (or tests are marked as xfail)
+
+Worflows:
+- continue running commands and tests until you are able to meet the acceptance criteria
+- use --fps 2 for call to the mp4_to_gif utility (to make processing faster) and use the demo video assets i docs/test-assets/demo.mp4 as the input.
+- you may mark tests XFAIL if you can't get them to run succesfully
\ No newline at end of file
```
We also are requesting new functionality from v1: like creating a unqiue output filename and adding a way to call this python repo from other directories (the `VIDSTR_CALLER_DIR` bullet point) and operate on relative paths within that directory (yes, we could make it an installed package but we're just trying a different pattern for now). 

The reasoning here is it is easier to give the full requirements of how we'll use this feature in spec once rather than apply it piecemeal over multiple specs. Also for this case, or other modules like `main.py` and `get_frame.py` already implement this functionality, so the agent should be able to copy the pattern over relatively easily.

##### Adding Documentation as Guides

We'll end up bringing in multiple sources of documentation for the moviepy package into this repo as [Guide Files](https://github.com/sutt/agro/tree/master/docs/core-concepts.md#agent-guide-documents) into Agro agents:

Any **.md** files in the `.agdocs/guides` directory will be passed to dispatched agents and read in when the agent starts. Here's what the directory looked like for this experiment:
```
# existing
GUIDE.md
python-genai.md
# added
moviepy.index.md
moviepy.portv2.md
moviepy.docs.md
```
The added documentation included manually typed instructions, select scraping of particular pages of the docs, and auto-generated full documentation.

**moviepy.index.md** - _(12 lines, 1 kB)_
This is a small file that provides URL's that the agent may scrape, provides package version info, and guidance of major do's and dont's.
>Vidstr uses moviepy package to do various video file processing tasks
Currently installed: moviepy 2.2.1
Important! Note: This is a v2 of the movie py package that has breaking changes from references of the code found on the internet that are assuming v1. 
See the file moviepy.portv2.md for more information about this or see: https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/getting_started/updating_to_v2.html
The api reference documentation is available in the moviepy.doc.md guide.
Public html site documentation is available here: https://zulko.github.io/moviepy

**moviepy.portv2.md** - _(232 lines, 9 kB)_
This was scraped from the documentation site itself which lives at: https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/. Specifically this page: https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/getting_started/updating_to_v2.html 

In particular which should help the LLM's to know that the moviepy v1.x solution they are familiar with neeed to be updated on certain method. This document was scraped from an html site and auto converted to markdown using [aider's scrape functionality](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/images-urls.html#web-pages) with this command: `python -m aider.scrape https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/getting_started/updating_to_v2.html`.


**moviepy.docs.md** - _(27,815 lines, 906 kB)_
This was created from [Repomix](https://repomix.com/) online doc generator using the default settings applied to the [moviepy repo](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy). This produced a very large single file document which takes up hundreds of thousands of tokens.

This drastically increases the token count of our agent requests by 30x for this small repo, which also greatly increases the costs as well (from several cents per request to almost a dollar at times for aider+Gemini-Pro). Although we'll accomplish the task of succesfully implementing v2 methods in the package, these should be a more compact and less costly approach to this. 

This process of including documentation for LLM's is an ongoing source of study for Agro and agentic coding in general. We'll be publishing solutions down the road to refine this practice.

##### Agentic behavior

We'll be giving our agents bash access / yolo mode to actually run commands to process mp4's into gifs to check their work. This will allow us to quickly check the solutions. 

Specifically the request to perform a demonstration output occurs in specs v2 implicitly and specs v3 as:
>- create output valid demo-001.gif in docs/test-assets (or similiarly named asset)
>- make sure this file has a > 0 kB size to ensure it's working

The way we allow our agents to run commands like the `uv run mp4_to_gif.py <args>` on the module they are creating is shown below for each agent type in Agro:
- **Aider**: we kickoff agro exec with the **--yolo** flag in agent_args as: 
    - `agro exec mp-infintie-gif-v3.md maider --yolo`
    - This causes the `maider` script to call the [agent-aider](https://github.com/sutt/agent-aider) (instead of normal aider) See [here](./aba-5.md#maider-as-wrapper-for-aider--aider-yolo) for more info on agentic aider.
- **Claude**: we set the default [Agent Configuration](../getting-started.md#agent-configuration) in `.agdocs/conf/agro.conf.yml` to allow WebSearch and full Bash:
    ``` 
    AGENT_CONFIG:
        claude:
            task_file_arg_template: null
            args: ["-d", "--allowedTools", "Write Edit MultiEdit WebFetch WebSearch Bash", "--max-turns", "120", "-p"]
    ```
- **Gemini**: Gemini comes with a built-in `-y` / `--yolo` mode which gives it full access to Bash. Again we pass this as an agent arg in agro exec as: `agro exec mp-infinite-gif-v3.md gemini --yolo`

Since this mode is realtively dangerous, I'll be running this on a VPS setup for just running YOLO agents, to protect my primary dev box. 

---
### Results

Now let's compare multiple runs of different combinations of with vs without guides, different prompt versions, and different agent permission levels. As with our previous case studies at their base agents use the following:
- Aider: v0.82, using Gemini-2.5-Pro
- Claude: v1.0.64, using Sonnet-4
- Gemini-CLI: v0.1.7, using Gemini-2.5-Pro


#### Results Output v1 - v2
These are the results generated out of combinations of:
- **prompt:** v1 / v2
- **guides:** none for moviepy, all three guides for moviepy, two guides for moviepy no including the large moviepy.docs.md file.

All agents are running in non-yolo mode here. We'll change that v3 below.

The main property we're looking for is the solution generated doesn't run into this problem and secondarily if it creates new tests that pass when run. 
```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'moviepy.editor'
```
Solutions which avoid this mistake are indicated in the table below of "MoviePy v2 Import" witha green check mark.

**Summary of results:**
- Without any Guide Files or any call out of the moviepy version in the spec (as occurs in prompt v2) the agents always generate the wrong code.
- As can be seen with v1 prompts, the util filename keeps changing between solutions, but remains the same in v2 (where we specify it).
- Aider looks to do best when it has minimal guide files, and only using prompt v1. It appears prompt v2 and v3 were very tricky for aider and end up having it produce no output (which is unusual in our experience).
- Claude does best on the opposite of where Aider excels: it produces an excellent solution when given full Guide Files and the v2 prompt with extra specificity.

    13:  prompt=v2  guides=full agent=aider
    14:  "          "           agent=claude

- outputs:
    1-5,7,8: all have v1 import errors
    11,13: appear to have not output any code
    14: has new tests but didn't put them in tests/ dir so they don't auto run

- notes:
    21 existing pytests,
    -> so if the output reports still 21 tests, it didn't run any new ones
    - for t14 we manually moved test file to get them to run
    - look for the err: "E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'moviepy.editor'"

#### Results Output v3

At this point we've some techniques for getting the agents to generate code based off the v2 version of the moveipy library, but let's take a look at adding full YOLO mode capabilties to these agents as well as the v3 prompt to see if we can make

Overview of results:
- Claude performed almost perfectly here. 
- Gemini was wild but had some wins. 
- Aider was hung up by multi-turn behavior and failed to generate code. See [section below](#appendix---aider-problem) for more info on this.

- run outputs:
    1,2,5: null result (see "aider problem" section)
    3-4: almost perfecto, some xfails 
        -3: 19 new tests, 1 xfail (which was defensive)
        -4: 17  new tests, 1 marked xfail should be marked skip since it hangs (test_empty_output_file_error)
    6: no output gif, all new tests xfail, utility works
    7: weird venv2, outputs gif (but not looping), 4 new tests pass, utility works, but not unique_fn
    8: outputs gif, util works, 1 new test passes

### Other Findings
Beyond working on the described feature and the augmentations, there were several interesting workflow tricks we learned here:

##### Custom muster commands

By adding in the request to produce a sample output (`demo-001.gif`) we're able to write a muster command to open the gif produced by every solution: ```agro muster 'code ./docs/test-assets/demo-001.gif' ```

Even running `agro diff --stat` we're able to see if the output asset was produced, e.g.:

```
--- Diff for t3 (output/mp-output-gif-v3.3) ---
$ git diff --stat tree/t3 HEAD
 docs/test-assets/demo-001.gif | Bin 0 -> 1679861 bytes

--- Diff for t4 (output/mp-output-gif-v3.4) ---
$ git diff --stat tree/t4 HEAD
 docs/test-assets/demo-001.gif | Bin 0 -> 1679861 bytes
```

Another interesting trick was to check out the CLI argument generated by each solution with: `agro muster 'uv run mp4_to_gif.py -h'` which produced this output:

```
--- Running command in t6 (output/mp-output-gif-v3.6) ---
$ uv run mp4_to_gif.py -h | head -n 2
usage: mp4_to_gif.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--fps FPS] video_path

--- Running command in t7 (output/mp-output-gif-v3.7) ---
$ uv run mp4_to_gif.py -h | head -n 2
usage: mp4_to_gif.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [--fps FPS] video_path

--- Running command in t8 (output/mp-output-gif-v3.8) ---
$ uv run mp4_to_gif.py -h | head -n 2
usage: mp4_to_gif.py [-h] [--fps FPS] input_file
```
This allows us to quickly look at the CLI api without having to checkout the branch and start working with it. This allows us to prefer quantity of generation over quality of code review. This is important when you are trying to maximize the potential of generative-ai to increase developer productivity.

##### Motivation for `agro muster -c safetest`

As mentioned earlier, the fact that this was a slow and heavy data processing task requested means some tests may operate slowly or even get stuck. When running tests interactively in the terminal this isn't a huge problem since we can't just Keyboard Interupt them when they do get stuck. But running them as background processes is a problem because the test will end up running forever and might throttle cpu hard. 

This happend several times while doing these experiments, which forced me to restart the VPS and re-ssh into it which was a pain-point that Agro should be solving. For this reason, Agro is now adding a timeout command to the default common commands for muster, as shown below and this should be available in Agro v0.1.8:

```diff
+  testq:
+    cmd: "uv run pytest --tb=no -q"
+  safetest:
+    cmd: "uv run pytest --tb=no -q"
+    timeout: 20
```

### Solution Gnerated

The ultimate solution is actually pretty small, the core of it looks like this:

```python
from moviepy import VideoFileClip

unique_output_path = get_unique_filepath(output_path)
    
with VideoFileClip(input_path) as clip:
    clip.write_gif(unique_output_path, fps=fps, loop=0)
```

There are other aspect to this like setting up the CLI parameters and parsing, and mocking and creating tests. Check out the Vidstr Repo for the full solution that was accepted.

### Conclusion

So we've examine how to **augment prompts**, **add test-case data**, **add guide files**, and **increase agentic permission** in order to improve solution generation on functionality that depends on external libraries, especially those with recent breaking changes. 

We've also taken a look at workflow tricks in Agro like custom muster commands to help quickly qualify or disqualify generated solutions from manual review.

This will provide a path forward for patterns to increase the solutions

#### Appendix - Aider problem

The following is where the agentic-aider got stuck everytime. It looks like it kept trying to load an .mp4 file into the agen't context like it was a text file. This caused an error and semmingly caused the agent to repeat a loop of what it just did, and got stuck looping.

```
You can run the new utility and tests with the following commands:

python mp4_to_gif.py docs/test-assets/demo.mp4 --fps 2
pytest tests/test_mp4_to_gif.py
