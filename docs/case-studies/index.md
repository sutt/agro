# Case Studies Index

This section contains case studies in using `agro`. Specifically in this case how to use _**A**gro to **B**uild **A**gro (**"ABA"**)_. But the ideas and techniques can be transferred to other coding projects and even other agent frameworks.

## Table of Contents

| Case Study | Summary | Date |
|------------|---------|------|
| [ABA-1: Using Multiple Agents for Feature Development](aba-1.md) | Demonstrates using multiple agents to implement an implicit taskfile feature, comparing solutions with git and pytest, and selecting the best implementation. Shows the complete workflow from task specification to acceptance. | July 8, 2025 |
| [ABA-2: Interactive Multi-prompt Development](aba-2.md) | Explores breaking complex tasks into smaller prompts, iterative development workflow, and the importance of reviewing and accepting solutions incrementally rather than attempting large monolithic changes. | July 9, 2025 |
| [ABA-3: Documentation Generation with AI](aba-3.md) | Covers using agents for documentation tasks like generating changelogs from git diffs and creating development summaries. Shows how AI can handle both structured documentation and content analysis. | July 14, 2025 |
| [ABA-4: UX Considerations in AI Development](aba-4.md) | Examines the role of human intelligence in AI-assisted development, particularly around UX decisions and product design. Shows how understanding user workflows informs better task specifications. | July 15, 2025 |
| [ABA-5: YOLO Mode and Command Execution](aba-5.md) | Compares different AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Aider) in "YOLO mode" for tasks requiring command execution. Demonstrates agent performance differences and the power of unrestricted command access. | July 16, 2025 |
| [ABA-6: Docs Generation with AI](aba-6.md) | Generating a version1 docs section with agents, and a look at the required manual interventions to get something accurate. | July 20, 2025 |
| [ABA-Vidstr-1: External Packages Example](aba-vidster-1.md) | Using a realtively necent pypi package in your repo presents challenges to agent workflow; learn how to deal with it. | July 23, 2025 |
| [ABA-Vidstr-2: External Packages + Agentic Commands](aba-vidstr-2.md) | Using an external package and checking results based on video processing outputs. | August 5, 2025 |
